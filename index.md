## 26.10. - 28.10.22 in MÃ¼nster, Germany

With an ever growing body of scientific knowledge and an explosion of data generated by computer-based experiments, the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of research data ([FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)) become key factors for further scientific progress. In Scientific Computing, beyond the actual simulation data the developed numerical algorithms, their implementations, procedural data, and their metadata descriptions are central research data. Establishing the FAIR principles for this data is the aim of the task area 'Scientific Computing' within the German Mathematical Research Data Initiative [MaRDI](https://www.mardi4nfdi.de/).

With this first MaRDI Workshop on Scientific Computing, we want to bring together researchers from the Scientific Computing community and related disciplines who are interested in the FAIRness of their research data. Apart from presentations on the current MaRDI projects and selected keynote talks, birds-of-a-feather sessions will leave room for discussions and hands-on tutorials. Further, we invite participants to contribute talks related to the following topics:

- Knowledge graphs and ontologies
- Software Interfaces
- Benchmarks
- Formal workflow descriptions
- Software distribution and archival
- Reproduction of numerical experiments
- Research data management

Participants are encouraged to present work in progress, open problems or report on personal experiences.

[Abstract submission](/participate) is open until **31.07.2022**.
